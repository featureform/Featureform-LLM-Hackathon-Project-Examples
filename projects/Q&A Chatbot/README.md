# 🎉 Q&A Chatbot Tutorial with Featureform, Pinecone, HuggingFace, and OpenAI 🚀

We're excited to guide you through setting up a Q&A chatbot using powerful tools from **Featureform**, **Pinecone**, **HuggingFace**, and **OpenAI** 

Featureform's new release (v0.9) comes packed with functionality for handling 'embeddings', a key ingredient for our chatbot.

In this guide, we’ll show you:
- How to use **Pinecone** as a vector database 📂;
- Utilize **HuggingFace's SentenceTransformers** in Featureform transformations
- Build and feed a prompt to **OpenAI's Davinci** to unleash the power of an LLM.
- Leverage **Featurefrom** to easily define, version, and document your embeddings 📝.

With the rapid popularity of embeddings and prompts alongside traditional ML features, treating embeddings as a special type of "features" stored in a "feature store" becomes operationally imperative.

This tutorial will empower you to address common challenges related to embedding versioning and synchronization between your document store and embeddings.

So, let's get started on this exciting journey towards building your own Q&A chatbot! 🎈

### Data 📊

We’ll use a dataset (and starter code) of the transcrapts

### Stack 🛠️

We’ll be using the following services: 
- **OpenAI** - For Q&A responses.
- **Pinecone** - For our vector database and inference store.
- **Featureform** - For our defining, versioning, and orchestrating our data pipeline.
- **HuggingFace** - To generate Embeddings

## The Steps 🧭

The overall steps for developing a Q&A Chatbot with Featureform are:

1. **Register Sources**
2. **Clean and Transform our Transcripts**
3. **Create Embeddings from our Transcripts**
4. **Register Pinecone as our Vector Database**
5. **Deploy our features and embeddings**
6. **Retrieve Relevent Documents**
7. **Create a contextualized prompt and feed it into OpenAI!**
