# 🎉 Q&A Chatbot Tutorial with Featureform, Redis, and OpenAI 🚀

We're excited to guide you through setting up a Q&A chatbot using powerful tools from **Featureform**, **Redis**, and **OpenAI**. 

Featureform's new release (v0.9) comes packed with functionality for handling 'embeddings', a key ingredient for our chatbot.

In this guide, we’ll show you:
- How to use **Redis** as a vector database 📂;
- Utilize **OpenAI’s Embedding and Chat Completion APIs** in PySpark functions 🧩;
- Leverage **Featurefrom** to easily define, version, and document your embeddings 📝.

With the rapid popularity of embeddings and prompts alongside traditional ML features, treating embeddings as a special type of "features" stored in a "feature store" becomes operationally imperative.

This tutorial will empower you to address common challenges related to embedding versioning and synchronization between your document store and embeddings.

So, let's get started on this exciting journey towards building your own Q&A chatbot! 🎈

## Pre-Requisites 📚

### Data 📊

We’ll use a dataset (and starter code) originally presented at the MLOps Community’s in-person “LLM Stack Hackathon” on June 3rd (sponsored by Redis, RelevanceAI, & Essence VC).

The `messages.csv` contains ~9K messages and threads from various channels within the MLOps community. We’ll focus on threads from the “mlops-questions-answered" and “discussions” channels (~2K messages). 

### Stack 🛠️

We’ll be using the following services: 
- **OpenAI** - For Embedding generation, text summarization, and Q&A responses.
- **Redis** - For our vector database and inference store.
- **Featureform** - For our feature platform, which will version, orchestrate and serve embeddings out of Redis. Also requires Azure Blob Store and Azure Databricks (Spark).
- **Additional** - Open AI Keys & Billing Enabled, Redis Cluster (larger than 50 MB & have Redis Search & Redis JSON), Open AI installed on the Redis Cluster.

## The Steps 🧭

The overall steps for developing a Q&A Chatbot with Featureform are:

1. **Configuration**: Ensure all provider configurations & keys are loaded.
2. **Register Providers**: Register the various providers & stores (Redis, Azure Blob, Azure Databricks) with Featureform.   
3. **Register Data Source(s)**: Register the `messages.csv` file as a data source for downstream transformations.
4. **Define & Register Batch Transformations**: Clean and filter the messages dataset to get the data in the right shape for Open AI’s Embedding API. Create embeddings using the "text-embedding-ada-002". 
5. **Register Entity**: Link and materialize the cleaned messages and their corresponding embeddings into Redis.
6. **Define On-Demand Function**: Generate embeddings and perform cosine similarity search on the fly.
7. **Define The Q&A Logic Itself**: Construct the final prompt using the most relevant Slack threads and OpenAI’s Chat Completion API.
