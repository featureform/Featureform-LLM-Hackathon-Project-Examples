Welcome, Cal Hacks Community! 🎉

## 🧠 Featureform and LLMs
Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-3, are powerful AI tools 🛠️ that generate responses based on text inputs. The more juicy context 📚 you feed into them, the better they perform. Whether you're refining your question or fine-tuning the LLM, remember: good data is the secret sauce! 🌟

Featureform is your ultimate helper at this hackathon. It's like a magical wand 🪄 that simplifies handling complex vector databases (crucial for working with LLMs). It lets you deploy, scale, and manage these databases easily, saving you time to focus on building your project. Plus, it reduces the nitty-gritty of the LLM data pipeline, manages and tracks your data changes. Best of all, it promotes team collaboration 🤝 and keeps your project data fresh, automatically processing and embedding new data. Now, you can concentrate on the fun part - hacking away! 💻🚀
